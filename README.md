# Data Science from Scratch
My repo of code following the 2nd edition of the book by Joel Grus

## Javascript
I've chosen to take a crack at this in Javascript because it's the language I've used the longest, and because I've already been through this book in Python, so I think it'll be a good challenge for me to translate it. Also, I think I really want to fulfill [Atwood's Law](https://medium.com/@jayaprabhakar/rethinking-atwoods-law-64a894b54aa4)

## Chapters
1. [Introduction](https://github.com/drakobian/data-science-from-scratch/blob/master/chapter_01.js)
2. [A crash course in Javascript (coming soon)](#)

## What's next
After translating the examples to JS, I'd like to use them in making an interactive website for teaching data science principles. Might need to get publishers permission to do that -- wish me luck!
